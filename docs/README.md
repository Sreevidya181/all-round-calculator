# Why I made this? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

I was thinking about making my own npm package/javascript library to help folks and developers ease their calculations. I googled, searched on YouTube and did some research on how to make my own npm package. And, after that finally, I made a demo package and thought of creating this one. This is my ***first npm package*** based on calculations.
